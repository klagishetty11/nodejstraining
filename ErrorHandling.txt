Error Handling in Node js 
    1. try / catch (for async/await)  --- readConfig1.js
    2. Error-First Callbacks (Node.js Convention) --- readConfig2.js
            DB Accesss, fileread 
            Parsing errors needed to handle separately from file errors 
    3. Centralized Error Handling (structured in real-world apps)
            Unifrom logging
            Central API error responses
            Works with validation, database, auth, etc.
